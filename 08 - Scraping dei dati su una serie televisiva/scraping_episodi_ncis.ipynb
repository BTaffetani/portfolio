        "Questa considerazione mette in risalto il limite principale di Pandas, che opera solo sulle tabelle in una pagina HTML. Di conseguenza, i dati che sono stati potuti raccogliere sono stati più limitati, al punto che per le informazioni su registi e autori ci si è appoggiati a una seconda fonte. Dall'altra parte, con BeautifulSoup abbiamo potuto estrarre le stesse informazioni da un'unica pagina (quella dell'episodio) e abbiamo ottenuto più dati sul cast, anche se il principale limite è stato in termini di pulizia dei dati e di connessione a Internet."
